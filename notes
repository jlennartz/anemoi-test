random notes

install cdsapi for datasets to work -> its a datastore client

generate dataset currently throws "required licences not accepted" -> download dataset for now from https://data.ecmwf.int/anemoi-datasets/era5-o48-2020-2021-6h-v1.zip

anemoi-graphs inspect needs a path and an output, which docu doesn't show

export ANEMOI_BASE_SEED=42 before training

converted the toy dataset zip file to .zarr

changed the resolution to o48 from n320
